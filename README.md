## Notes
- Django REST framework right now does not support adding new sensors via POST because there is no way to link user (use admin console)

## Info
STEM Hacks 2021 hackathon/design project competition idea for Team Rote Sphere
Concept: Website that gamifies reducing energy/water use. Compete with others in your neighbourhood and aim for the top of the leaderboard!
This website will feature not only leaderboards, but also visualizations of your power and water use. 
For example, your power use will be listed not only in kWh, but also in cost associated with that much power and also in what was required to generate that power. 
This project will promote conscientious usage of power and water in the home, while also hopefully creating a fun and friendly competition betwee neighbours.
